# Dealbreaker - Real time dating application

Another dating app?! These apps are becoming more stressful than job interviews...

Curiosity leads to optimism, optimism leads to excitement, and excitement leads to... deflated and lonely watching Homeland for 7 straight hours on a Sunday night... just me?...

We want the ease of swiping left or right and matching with people whose pictures we like (because of course physical attraction matters! We aren't your grandma - it's fine)

But we know that you also value a connection and conversation that helps you decide if you'll take the scary plunge and, you know, actually GO on a date.

But convo's such as:

"Hey!"
"Hello"
"Nice photo !"
"Thanks!"
"Like cats?"
"no."

Dealbreakers. the app.
No excuses anymore! We've got your dealbreakers covered.

Problem Statement

- A dating app that gives you connection first, with easy effort on the user to start a relevant conversation (at the time you actually feel like having a conversation) but still values your potential importance on physical attraction as well

## Proposed Solution

- Think, HQ meets The Dating Game
- Every night at 8:00, jump onto the dealbreakers game where contestants have also joined
- All contestants waiting to play the game are pooled in images at the bottom of the screen, but... they are blurred out
- In real-time, as the clock strikes 8:00, the current game is LOCKED IN and for 5 mins, questions appear with multiple choice answers
- Submit your answer to the question - and when the timer on that question ends - based on your % match, contestants pictures start to clear
- But we still have some questions to go!
- As you reach the end of the game, your top matches will be fully revealed! And you can start a conversation with plenty to talk about (these questions will guarantee that!)
